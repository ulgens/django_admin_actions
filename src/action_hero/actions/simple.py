    This is the simplest "useful" implementation of ``AdminActionBaseClass``. It
    only calls the provided ``function`` with the primary key of each record in
    the ``queryset``. Because the default ``condition`` is always ``True``, this
    action will be carried out for every record.

    Example usage::

        titlecase_titles_action = SimpleAction(function=str.title)

        class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
            actions = [titlecase_titles_action]
            model = MyModel

    This will call ``str.title`` on each record's ``title`` attribute. Because
    this doesn't involve a database write, the change is immediately discarded.
